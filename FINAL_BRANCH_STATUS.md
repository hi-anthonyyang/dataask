## Successfully Completed Actions

### 1. Merged to Main
âœ… **cursor/scan-code-and-markdown-files-4d94**
   - UI text updates: "Add database or import data file"
   - CSV import performance optimizations
   - Already pushed to origin/main

### 2. Deleted Branches (30 branches with conflicts)
All branches that had merge conflicts with main have been deleted from the remote repository.

### 3. Remaining Clean Branches (7 branches)
These branches have NO conflicts and can be merged cleanly:

1. **cursor/assess-data-storage-and-caching-strategies-9426**
2. **cursor/check-csv-and-xlsx-file-upload-support-697a**
3. **cursor/fix-electron-connection-refused-errors-d891**

6. **cursor/test-file-import-system-functionality-9e28**
7. **cursor/test-sqlite-macos-path-compatibility-618b**

## Current Status
- Main branch is up to date with UI text changes
- 30 conflicting branches have been removed
- 7 clean branches remain that can be easily merged
- No authentication system or other complex features remain (they were in the deleted branches)

## Next Steps
You can now:
1. Fetch the latest main branch with: `git fetch origin main && git checkout main && git pull`
2. The remaining 7 branches can be merged if needed, but they appear to be smaller fixes
3. The codebase is now simplified without the complex authentication system
