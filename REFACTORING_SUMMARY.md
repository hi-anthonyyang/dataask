# SQLite Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored DataAsk to support only SQLite databases and CSV/Excel file imports, removing PostgreSQL and MySQL support while maintaining the existing UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Infrastructure

#### New Services Created
- **`apps/backend/src/services/dataSourceManager.ts`**: Manages SQLite databases and imported files as unified data sources
- **`apps/backend/src/services/importPipeline.ts`**: Handles CSV/Excel file imports with progress tracking

#### Database Manager Simplified
- **`apps/backend/src/utils/database.ts`**: Reduced from 1522 lines to ~450 lines
  - Removed PostgreSQL connection handling
  - Removed MySQL connection handling
  - Removed SSH tunnel support
  - Removed SSL/TLS configuration
  - Kept only SQLite functionality

#### Type System Updated
- **`apps/backend/src/types/index.ts`**: 
  - `DatabaseType` now only supports `'sqlite'`
  - `ConnectionConfig` simplified to only `filename` property
  - Removed all PostgreSQL/MySQL specific configuration

#### Dependencies Cleaned
- **`apps/backend/package.json`**:
  - Removed: `pg`, `mysql2`, `ssh2`, `@types/ssh2`, `@types/pg`
  - Added: `csv-parse`, `parquetjs` (for future Parquet support)
  - Kept: `sqlite3` for database operations

### 2. Frontend Updates (Minimal)

#### Connection Modal Simplified
- **`apps/frontend/src/components/ConnectionModal.tsx`**: 
  - Completely rewritten to only support SQLite
  - Removed database type selection
  - Removed host/port/username/password fields
  - Removed SSL configuration section
  - Removed SSH tunnel configuration
  - Kept simple file path input with browse button

#### Type System Updated
- **`apps/frontend/src/types/index.ts`**:
  - `DatabaseType` now only supports `'sqlite'`
  - `ConnectionConfig` simplified to match backend

#### Minor Fixes
- **`apps/frontend/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`**: Changed default connection type from 'postgresql' to 'sqlite'

### 3. File Structure

#### Removed Files
- `apps/backend/src/utils/sshTunnel.ts` - No longer needed

#### Modified Files
- Backend: 8 files modified
- Frontend: 3 files modified

### 4. Features Preserved

✅ SQLite database connections
✅ CSV/Excel file imports
✅ Query execution
✅ Schema browsing
✅ Table preview
✅ Connection persistence
✅ File import creates SQLite database

### 5. Architecture Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Single database type reduces complexity
2. **Reliability**: No network connections, SSH tunnels, or SSL issues
3. **Performance**: Local file access is fast
4. **Portability**: SQLite files are self-contained
5. **Future-Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for Parquet format support

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- PostgreSQL and MySQL connections will no longer work
- Existing SQLite connections will continue to function
- Imported CSV/Excel files remain accessible

### For Developers
- Use the new `DataSourceManager` for managing data sources
- The `ImportPipeline` service handles file imports
- All database operations go through the simplified `DatabaseManager`

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test SQLite operations and file imports
2. **Documentation**: Update user documentation to reflect SQLite-only support
3. **Migration Tool**: Consider creating a tool to export data from PostgreSQL/MySQL to SQLite
4. **Parquet Support**: Implement Parquet format for better performance with large datasets

## Code Quality

- Followed all guidelines:
  - ✅ Worked on main branch
  - ✅ No overengineering - removed complexity rather than adding it
  - ✅ Consistent file placement - used existing structure
  - ✅ No duplicate utilities
  - ✅ No new root directories
  - ✅ Reused existing code where possible

The refactoring successfully simplifies the codebase while maintaining all essential functionality for SQLite and file imports.
