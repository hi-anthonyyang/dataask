## Current Main Branch Status
- Latest commit: 2c6f829
- Includes all UI text updates
- Has optimized CSV import with prepared statements

## Remaining Branches Analysis
After reviewing the 37 unmerged branches, I found that many of them seem to include:
- Authentication system (JWT, user management)
- Additional security features
- Various UI improvements
- Test infrastructure

## Recommendation
The remaining branches appear to be interconnected with many overlapping changes. 
It seems like there was a major feature development (authentication system) that 
many branches are based on.

To proceed safely:
1. Identify which branch introduced the authentication system first
2. Merge that foundational branch
3. Then merge the smaller feature branches that depend on it

## Next Steps
1. Review the authentication-related branches to find the base one
2. Test the current main branch to ensure CSV import and UI changes work
3. Plan a careful merge strategy for the remaining features
