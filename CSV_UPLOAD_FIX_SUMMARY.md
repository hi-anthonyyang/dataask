# CSV/Excel Upload Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Preload Script Error**: The Electron preload script was trying to use Node.js modules (`fs`, `path`, `os`) directly, which is not allowed with `contextIsolation: true`.

2. **Connection Persistence**: After importing a CSV/Excel file, the created connection wasn't being found by the frontend, causing the "Failed to load the imported data" error.

3. **Missing Data Directory**: The `/workspace/data` directory didn't exist, preventing connection persistence.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Preload Script (`apps/electron-shell/src/preload.js`)
- Removed direct usage of Node.js modules
- Replaced with IPC calls to the main process
- All file system operations now go through `ipcRenderer.invoke()`

### 2. Added IPC Handlers (`apps/electron-shell/src/main.ts`)
- Added `fs:fileExists` handler
- Added `fs:getFileStats` handler  
- Added `fs:resolvePath` handler
- Added `fs:getHomeDirectory` handler

### 3. Improved Connection Persistence (`apps/backend/src/utils/database.ts`)
- Made `persistConnections()` method public and async
- Added verification that the connections.json file was written
- Added error re-throwing to ensure failures are caught

### 4. Created Data Directory
- Created `/workspace/data` directory for storing connections.json and imported SQLite files

## How the Import Process Works

1. User uploads CSV/Excel file via FileImportModal
2. Backend creates a new SQLite database in `/workspace/data/`
3. Backend creates a table and imports the data
4. Backend creates a connection entry and persists it to `connections.json`
5. Backend returns the connectionId to the frontend
6. Frontend tries to load the new connection from the connections list
7. Frontend selects the new connection

## Remaining Issues to Monitor

1. **Timing Issue**: There may still be a race condition where the frontend tries to load connections before the backend has finished persisting them. The retry logic in `DataAskApp.tsx` should handle this, but it needs testing.

2. **Electron Mode**: The fix for the preload script needs to be tested in Electron mode to ensure the IPC handlers work correctly.

3. **Backend Startup**: Ensure the backend server starts properly and loads persisted connections on startup.

## Testing Steps

1. Start the backend: `cd apps/backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd apps/frontend && npm run dev`
3. Upload a CSV or Excel file
4. Verify the connection appears in the connections list
5. Verify you can query the imported data

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix in both web and Electron modes
2. Add better error handling for connection persistence failures
3. Consider adding a loading state while connections are being persisted
4. Add unit tests for the IPC handlers and connection persistence
